<h2>What is TolkienValues?</h2>
    <p>TolkienValues is a fork of the popular <a href="https://8values.github.io/">8values political quiz</a> with a Tolkien-fan twist! It's a political-style quiz that attempts to assign percentages for different attitudes towards J.R.R. Tolkien's works. As in the original quiz, you will be presented by a statement, and then you will answer with your opinion on the statement, from <b>Strongly Agree</b> to <b>Strongly Disagree</b>, with each answer slightly affecting your scores. At the end of the quiz, your answers will be compared to the maximum possible for each value, thus giving you a percentage. Answer honestly!<br /><br />
    There are <b><u><span id="numOfQuestions"></span></u></b> questions in the test.</p>

<h2>What are the Tolkien values?</h2>
    <p>There are five independent axes - Media, Canonicity, Focus, Scholarship, and Balrog Wings - and each has two opposing values assigned to them. They are:</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#d32f2f;">Books</b> (Media)<br/>
        Those with higher Books scores are primarily fans of Tolkien's original works. They tend to believe that adaptations should closely follow the source material, and don't enjoy frivolous artistic licence.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#00796b;">Adaptations</b> (Media)<br/>
        Those with higher Adaptations scores are primarily fans of adaptations of Tolkien's works - films, games, and so on. They tend to enjoy different portrayals of the story and aren't so strict about what is or isn't 'canon'.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#f57c00;">Authorial</b> (Canonicity)<br/>
        Those with higher Authorial scores believe that Middle-earth canon is defined by Tolkien's latest or most developed writings, which can supercede the published works. They tend to enjoy the more obscure books such as the History of Middle-earth series.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#0288d1;">Published</b> (Canonicity)<br/>
        Those with higher Published scores take the published books as canon. They tend to prefer the more popularly accepted versions of the stories, and may see more obscure writings as unfinished drafts and mere curiosities.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#fbc02d;">Narrative</b> (Focus)<br/>
        Those with higher Narrative scores enjoy Tolkien's works for their stories and characters. They see Middle-earth as a backdrop for excellent stories, and aren't so interested in questions of what lies beyond the borders of maps or outside of recorded history.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#303f9f;">World</b> (Focus)<br/>
        Those with higher World scores prefer the world-building aspect of Tolkien's works. They consider Middle-earth as an object of interest in itself which is larger than the stories, and like to speculate on areas of the world and timeline that Tolkien never described in detail.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#689f38;">Lambengolmo</b> (Scholarship)<br/>
        Those with higher Lambengolmo scores take a deep interest in the denser aspects of Tolkien's world. They may have studied the Elvish languages, learned to write with Tengwar, or kept time by Shire Reckoning.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#7b1fa2;">Casual</b> (Scholarship)<br/>
        Those with higher Casual scores see Tolkien's world as a source of entertainment first and foremost. They don't usually care for his invented languages beyond their appearance in the stories.</p>
	<p class="value-description"><b style="color:#d32f2f;">Wings</b> (Balrog Wings)<br/>
        Those with higher Wings scores believe, quite correctly, that Balrogs have wings.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#00796b;">No Wings</b> (Balrog Wings)<br/>
        Those with higher No Wings scores know the indisputable truth: Balrogs don't have wings.</p>
<h2>What's the "Closest Match" mean at the bottom of the results?</h2>
    <p>In addition to matching you to the Tolkien values, the quiz also attempts to match you to a stereotypical fan group. This is a work in progress and is much less accurate than the values and axes, so don't take it too seriously. If you disagree with your closest match, </p>
<h2>I don't like my scores!</h2>
